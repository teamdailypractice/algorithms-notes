# How to identify?

* Is it a "range queries in an array" problem?
* The minima/maxima element or the monotonic order of elements in a range is useful to get answer of every range query
* Can I ignore the popped out elements from the monotonic stack?

## Keywords

* Array
* Range query
* Minima
* Maxima

## Tips/Tricks

* For **greater** problems, use a monotonically **increasing** stack (from top to bottom).
* For **smaller** problems, use a monotonically **decreasing** stack (from top to bottom).
* For **next** problems, **backwardly iterate** through the list and push elements into the stack.
* For **previous** problems, **forwardly iterate** through the list.
* For **circular list** problems, **iterate through the list twice**
